# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Does Not Meet Expectations**. I don't see a readme anywhere! A readme (separate from the one that we gave with the project) is super helpful for informing users what your project is all about. It's a great place to include user stories, installation instructions, challenges encountered, wireframes and much more. Encourage you to make one even though we're past project week!

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Really enjoyed playing with your app! It did a great job of applying what you've learned so far. It was also fun seeing how you got creative with extra features (e.g., box with additional answer info and image). Next step here would be to implement the same functionality with DRY-er code. But based on our conversations, it seems that you're already thinking about that!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Good job here! Indentation and styling was consistent and you made use of code comments. There are opportunities to clean things up though. Some things to consider are consolidating code comments and ways to make your code DRYer. As you pointed out in your project submission, the JS file is a bit long! Take a look at my inline code comments for more...

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**. Based on our discussions about the project and your presentation, it's clear you put a lot of thought and work into this. You should be very proud of what you accomplished here. I know the class moves as a fast pace, but when you get the chance try refactoring this and acting on some of the comments I left here and inline in your code.
